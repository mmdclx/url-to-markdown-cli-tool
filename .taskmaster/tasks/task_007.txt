# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement File I/O and Output Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Handle file output, console output, and UTF-8 encoding for processed markdown content
# Details:
Implement output handling in output_manager.js: write to specified file with -o option, output to stdout by default, handle UTF-8 encoding correctly, manage file permissions and error handling. Add proper async/await handling for file operations and integrate with the main processing pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Test file output with various file paths and permissions, verify UTF-8 character handling, test stdout output formatting, validate error handling for write failures
