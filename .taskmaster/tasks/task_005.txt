# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Markdown Conversion Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace html2text with turndown library for HTML to Markdown conversion optimized for LLMs
# Details:
Create markdown_processor.js using turndown library. Configure turndown rules for clean LLM-friendly output: preserve heading hierarchy, maintain list structures, handle links appropriately (with --no-links option), optimize whitespace handling, ensure proper line breaks and formatting. Add custom rules for better structure preservation.

# Test Strategy:
Compare markdown output quality with original Python version, test with various HTML structures (tables, lists, headings), verify LLM readability and structure preservation
