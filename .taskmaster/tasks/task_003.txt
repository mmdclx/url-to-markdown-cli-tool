# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Web Page Fetching with Puppeteer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace Selenium-based page fetching with Puppeteer for JavaScript implementation
# Details:
Create page_fetcher.js module using Puppeteer to launch Chrome browser, navigate to URLs, wait for page load, handle dynamic content. Implement both headless and visible browser modes. Add configurable wait times, proper error handling for network timeouts, and support for different page load strategies. Ensure UTF-8 content handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various website types including SPAs, static sites, and dynamic content. Verify headless/visible modes work correctly, test timeout handling and error scenarios
